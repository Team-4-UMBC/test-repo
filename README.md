## Instructions

1. Have react installed - I am using npm 10.5.0
2. Have yarn installed - I have 1.22.22
3. Have node installed - I have 21.7.2

#### Setup the venv

`cd api`

`python3 -m venv venv`

`. venv/bin/activate`

#### Running the backend
I have set it up so that you can run flask from the main directory by running `yarn start-api`

This should work on linux based computers, I haven't tested on windows.
